After attending the fortnightly workshops where we were taught the basic information on coding, design, storytelling and much more. We were invited to be involved in a Game Jam, it was a fantastic expereince and I cant wait to be involved again this year! Not everyone can say they have made a game from scratch in one weekend... I have (with help from the Level Her Up Team of course)!
